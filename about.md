I'm Marian Steinbach, born 1977 in Cologne/Germany. I am a user experience designer by profession, a cyclist by passion, and father of a little girl. This is my blog.

I have been occupying this URL with personal stuff since [1999](https://web.archive.org/web/19980815000000*/http://www.sendung.de). Then, blogging fatigue, or rather social media fatigue hit me hard and I quit blogging.

Now, in December 2016, I want to claim my stake again. After roughly two years of only sucking from the web and making use of other people's contributions, I feel like contributing little bits and pieces again. I feel like communicating and connecting again. And I strongly believe that there is no better place for this than my own, personal blog.

Let's see where this goes.

This blog is built using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub pages.
