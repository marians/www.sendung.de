# Hello 👋

**Welcome to the place where I publish various thoughts, hoping that they are of value to anyone else.**

Most of my content is in English, some is in German.

## What happened recently

### January 2026

The [Digital Independence Day](https://di.day/) initiative by German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) is a promising campaign to raise awareness about digital sovereignty and strikes close to home. It inspired me to adress a few dependencies in my own digital life. And, of course, it reminded me that a personal blog is a nice and independent piece of sovereign communication to have.

### November 2025

I've launched a hyper-local journalism project for my home town: [rösrathblog](https://roesrathblog.de/). The idea is to grow it into a community-driven platform that doesn't depend too much on me.

### February 2025

Video: [Wie Ihr Euch ein Mastodon-Konto auf GRUENE.SOCIAL einrichtet](https://peertube.netzbegruenung.de/w/fh378NDtwuf9szAGfj8PRf). Richtet sich an Mitglieder und Gliederungen von BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN.

### September 2024

💦 New article: [Relative humidity is misleading]({{< relref "/articles/2024-09-23-relative-humidity-dewpoint" >}}) explains how I found that to keep the basement dry, I have to watch the dewpoint instead of relative humidity.

### August 2022

🫶 I'm starting to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with (HUGO) sites hosted on Codeberg and [this little post](https://blog.spacebear.ee/post/deploy-gitea-repos-to-netlify/) was a great help.

### July 2022
