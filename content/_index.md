# Hello 👋

**Welcome to the place where I publish various thoughts, hoping that they are of value to anyone else.**

Most of my content is in English, some is in German.

💭 As I'm working in the business of compute and hosting, I'm thinking a lot about the sustainability (in an environment sense) of application hosting lately. And I'm thinking that with decentralized applications like Mastodon, which are designed to be run in many independend installations, often by semi-professional admins, developers should take the footprint of running these applications into consideration. Reducing energy consumption and maximizing machine utilization should be a priority. I may write about this.
