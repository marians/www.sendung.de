It was time for several updates. This site is now

- hosted by [Codeberg](https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/) instead of GitHub,
- created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) instead of Jekyll,
- using a different [template/theme](https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme).

I'm also [contributing](https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amarians) as few additions to the Hugo theme.
